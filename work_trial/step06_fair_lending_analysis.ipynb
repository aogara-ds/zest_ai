    "Fair lending analysis is an essential component of any credit modeling process. In order to analyze the equity impacts of a model, you need to be able to identify the protected demographic characteristics of customers, and then measure the model outcomes for different demographic groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your dataset contains two wonderful nuggets of fair lending information: the applicant's ZIP code, and their last name. Using these two datapoints, we can implement the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's [BISG methodology](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201409_cfpb_report_proxy-methodology.pdf) for estimating race. BISG requires several steps:\n",
    "* Extracting Last Name from the Email Address provided in this data file\n",
    "    * Exploiting the capitalization schema of the email addresses can help\n",
    "* Merging with the [Decennial Census Surname Files](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/surnames.html), which contain race by surname\n",
    "* Calculate protected demographics by ZIP code using federal surveys such as the [2020 American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data.html)\n",
    "* Merge with ZIP codes provided in the applicant data\n",
    "* Combine the geographic probabilities with the surname probabilities using Bayesian updating rules\n",
    "\n",
    "This will provide each applicant's estimated racial profile, which can generate key statistics such as:\n",
    "* Adverse Impact Ratio: The ratio of approval rates between the highest approval rate group and the lowest\n",
    "* False Positive assessment: Is one race more likely than another to be falsely predicted to default?\n",
    "* False Negative assessment: Similarly, is one race more likely to be falsely predicted as safe?\n",
    "* See [this](https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/article-abstract/37/3/585/6374682?redirectedFrom=fulltext#303976608) paper for a more comprehensive definition of fair lending statistics across performance parity, separation, and sufficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing this estimation and assessment methodology will show which models are the fairest, and how well the models perform on fairness overall. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would also be interest in implementing the XGBoost fair lending regularizer proposed by [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01442.pdf). Authors successfully reduce the approval rate gap between protected groups by 50% or more for several different datasets. "
