# Building a Credit Underwriting Policy
Work Trial for Zest AI 
Aidan O'Gara, Senior Data Scientist Candidate

This work trial constructs a credit policy for a hypothetical Zest client based on customer application and loan performance data. The credit policy includes but does not wholly consist of a novel credit score built with XGBoost and trained on a sample client data. 

All of the best documentation is included in the individual notebooks. I would particularly recommend step_00 for the construction of a dynamic data dictionary, step_01 for extracting new features from the dataset, step_04 for an explanation of the XGBoost hyperparameter tuning, and step_06 for a fair lending analysis plan. 

A few slides I presented to the team on how this data analyis fits into the broader puzzle of building an underwriting policy can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SR3axw8LLGhZUoMuZORY9zgajtAAqdMoYNoddBxtBGc/edit?usp=sharing). 

The results of this repository are fully reproducible. Begin by importing the Excel file you sent me into the /input_data/ folder, then run each notebook in full in the provided order. Please reach out if you run into any trouble, and hope to hear from you soon!
